# PyYtDl
GUI for youtube-dl
This is a GUI for Youtube-dl which can be downloaded from https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html 
I have included the latest version which was available when I created the Git.
This can download videos from anywhere making it a multipurpose GUI based application.
Just as owning a knife does not make you a killer, using youtube-dl is not illegal unless used on YouTube itself.
STEPS TO MAKE IT WORK-
Download latest version of python 2.7 
Download the latest version of youtube-dl
Download or clone this Git
Open beta.py
